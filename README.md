A number of regex patterns which are designed to identify click-bait headlines without information. 

Bad headlines are headlines which do not provide an abstract of the article. Rather, they provide a question or hint of what the article contains. They are inefficent and designed so that users will click and then determine if they will read an article. 

Good headlines provide information which readers can use to make better decisions about which articles they click through.

###To Do

- Current regex patterns match headlines, not tweets with URLs. Update negative tests and reconfigure.
